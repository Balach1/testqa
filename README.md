This project is was created to give me a better understanding of how selenium works when writing in C#.
For this project I have used the website "www.http://toolsqa.com" as a guide
and following the step by step tutorial it offers to help understand how to set it up and how it works.

For this project I am using a MacBook pro running OSX Sierra

Since I am using C# to write the tests, Using Microsoft visual studio doesn't work on mac's.
